- **PIL**: Image loading and manipulation

### Algorithm Flow
1. Load image using both OpenCV and PIL
2. Define flexible red color ranges in HSV and RGB
3. Detect STM area in bottom-right section
4. Extract STM region and convert to HSV
5. Apply dual HSV range masks for red detection
6. Apply RGB range mask as backup
7. Combine masks and find pixel coordinates
8. Convert relative to absolute coordinates
9. Visualize results with marked pixels
10. Save analysis results

## Conclusion

The analysis successfully identified a significant number of red pixels (20,880) in the STM indicator area, confirming the presence of red elements in the rightmost data of the indicator. The program provides a comprehensive solution for pixel color analysis in financial charts with robust detection methods and clear visualization of results.

The generated images clearly show the detected red pixels marked with yellow circles, making it easy to verify the analysis results and understand the distribution of red pixels in the STM indicator area.
